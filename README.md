# Team Snek - Ben Hill, Alan Karlo Mangubat, Mason Fryberger, and Matthew Holder

# Description
Full-stack Django Application with React front-end; Designed for Code Fellows to allow staff to easily track, grade and schedule final whiteboard exams. Uses API calls to canvas to populate student lists and OAUTH with slack to allow staff log-ins. Automates the grading process.

Below is a copy of the team agreement detailing, communication plan, workflow, git-flow, and conflict resolution.

## Communication Plan

As a group we agree to encourage open communication where all voices are equal. We will listen intentionally, giving each voice equal weight and consideration. We will do our best not to interrupt, allowing the speaker to reach their point even if not yet fully formed.
We will NOT tolerate any form of abusive or harassing communication. We will welcome all viewpoints, and discuss disagreements as a conversation, not as dueling monologues.
We acknowledge that we have unique backgrounds and history and will embrace these differences as strengths. We also acknowledge that we bring differing skill levels to this project, and will do our best to keep everyone on the same page: our collective learning is just as important as the final product.
We acknowledge that we are still working outside of CodeFellows, and that life happens. Should any team member fall behind or seem to be slacking, we won’t jump to conclusions. We will check in with each other on a human level, ensuring that each team member is doing alright. If someone is struggling, we will do our best to support them, but ask that they contribute their fair share as best they can.

## Conflict Plan

When any conflict arises, we agree to listen to the other viewpoint in its entirety. Even if we disagree with our teammate, we still respect them and acknowledge that everyone’s thoughts and feelings are valid. But if we cannot find compromise, we will ask another teammate to consider the differing viewpoints, asking that they remain as objective as possible. If this still does not lead to consensus, we will ask the TA’s, and then Roger for input. At the end of the day, we agree that we want what is best for our project and for our own learning.
If we have a significant issue outside of dedicated working sessions, we will @name through Slack each other for more immediate response - however we understand that responses may well not come until the next morning or after work.
If there is a split vote, we are going to use a coin flip app.

## Work Plan

Dedicated working sessions follow class schedule - we agree to work on our project Mon-Thur 6:30-9:30pm and Saturday from 9am-6pm. We agree to discuss extra working hours as needed.
Accountability for work and reaching out early if you are struggling and feeling as though you will not meet the deadline.
Communication is key! At every stage of our project, we will meet as a group and determine the following:

1. What is the end goal for this part of the project
2. What steps are required to achieve that goal
3. How can these steps be evenly distributed across the four of us (remember pair/mob programming!)
At the start of each work session, we will check-in as a group to see where each team member is at regarding their currently assigned task. If anyone is significantly struggling with their assigned workload, this will be a time to brainstorm solutions with the rest of the team. At least 10 minutes should be allotted for this.

At the end of each session, we will recap what has been accomplished and what the game plan is for the next session, so that we can hit the ground running. At least 10 minutes should be allotted for this.
If questions arise during a work session, we will reach out to one-another to ask for guidance.

## Git Process

Daily PR before work session at 6:30
Wrap up PR at end of work session at 9:30
May PR more if needed (particularly for route setup)
Master branch will only be working versions
Dev branch is where we can break things
Never work on the same feature as another team member. This will help us avoid merge conflicts
Anything Else:
Learning is the primary objective! Let’s have fun supporting each other as we move towards greater understanding and more coding competency :)
